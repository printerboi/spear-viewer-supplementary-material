# Class based raytracer

The program implements a raytracer using an object oriented approach.
On execution the application will generate a ppm image with a sphere in the center of the viewpoint.

### Attribution;

The demo code is based on the book [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
by Peter Shirley et al. The implementation follows the first five chapters.
