The system submodule contains all the information needed to recreate the original system the study was performed on.

## Structure

- **machine_specs.json**: [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) report of the system containing information about the CPU, GPU, OS, Kernel etc.
- **profile.json**: Original `profile.json` calculated on the study system. Already contained in the `Study/Code/` tasks folders
