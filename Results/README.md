## Structure

The submodule is seperated into the following structure

- **raw_data/**: The folder `raw_data` contains all raw data collected during the study. The folder is seperated in a folder for each participant, where each folder is named after the ID of the participant. Each folder contains the protocol written during the study(`protocol.md`), the recording (`recording.mkv`) and the associated recording protocol (`recording_protocol.md`). Also the calculated results (`result.csv`) and the edited tasks (`tasks.zip`) of each participant can be found here
- **measurements_evaluation.ods**: An `.ods` file containing all the collected measurements of the study split per group. Additionally some comparison tables are calculated.
- **questionnaire_evaluation.ods**: An `.ods` file containing all results collected from the questionnaires filled out by the participants. The data is split per group and also contains a legend for the used questions. See the study submodule for the `.pdf` file of the questionnaire.
