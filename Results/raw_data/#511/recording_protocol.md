# Recording protocol for participant \#511

- [02:00] Participant made use of the callgraph, by collapsing all functions to the top level
- [03:30] Participant changed sort method and added another shifting operation
- [05:00] Removed unnecessary shifting
- [07:30] Replaces = with c++ XOR operator ^=
- [13:30] Removed second sort 
- [16:00] Switch to task_2
- [18:20] Google "c++ std string emplace const char"
- [18:45] Google "cpp add const char to empty string"
- [21:50] Person made temperature functions inline
- [23:40] Undid inlining
- [27:25] Made temperature functions return the value directly
- [29:00] Moved temperature calculations directly to if condition in handler function
- [32:00] Moved temperature symbol from second if condition to first if condition alongside actual calculation
- [35:25] Switch to task_3
- [37:50] Google "cpp math pow"
- [40:00] Replaced custom pow calculation with pow of std lib
- [43:50] Moved calculation to switch case
- [46:20] Done
